#TuringBall Nested Iteration Challenge

The `spec/league_spec.rb` file is the only spec file with skipped tests. Start with this file, and the first skipped test. Unskip this test, and add code to the `lib/league.rb` file in order to make the test pass. Unskip the following two tests as you come to them in order to make each of those tests pass as well.

When making the tests pass, do not change anything or add any additional code within the test file aside from unskipping the tests.

Go through this exercise, and once you finish (or you need a little extra help), look at the solutions branch on this repo to see how I built the methods to make the tests pass.

Remember, there is no one correct answer. If you made all the tests pass on your own then that's great! I added some comments in my solution to help you gain a better understanding of why I built my methods the way that I did.

Good luck!
