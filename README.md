## TuringBall

This branch has the solutions to the unpassed tests on the main branch. Go into `lib/league.rb` to see the three new methods created in order to make the tests pass from `spec/league_spec.rb`

Run `rspec` to run all tests, or `rspec spec/league_spec.rb` to only run the tests from that specific file.
